## Introduction

Welcome to the C Programming Concepts repository! Here, you will find code examples and explanations for various fundamental concepts in the C programming language. The organized structure of the repository makes it easy to explore and learn at your own pace.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a structured organization, with each concept having its own dedicated folder. This makes it easy to navigate and focus on specific topics without getting overwhelmed.

## List of Concepts

1. [Variables](./variables): Understanding and using variables in C.
2. [Operators](./operators): Exploring different operators in C.
3. [Switch Statement](./switch): Implementing the switch statement.
4. [If...Else Statement](./if_else): Using conditional statements in C.
5. [Data Types](./data_types): Overview of various data types in C.
6. [Comments](./comments): Writing effective comments in C.
   <!-- Add more concepts as needed -->

## Usage

### Running Programs

To run the C programs from the command line (CMD), follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the concept you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/concept_folder
   ```
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

### Using Notepad

If you prefer using a simple text editor like Notepad to write and edit C code, follow these steps:

1. Open Notepad.
2. Copy the code from the concept folder's `.c` file.
3. Save the file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `program_name.c`).
4. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the saved `.c` file.
5. Compile and run the program using the steps mentioned in the "Running Programs" section.

Feel free to choose your preferred text editor or IDE for writing and running C programs.

## Included Concepts

### Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In C, variables must be declared with a specific data type, and they can be used to store different types of information.

### Operators

Operators in C are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and relational operators (==, !=, <, >).

### Switch Statement

The switch statement is used to evaluate a variable or expression against multiple possible values. It provides an efficient way to handle multiple conditions.

### If...Else Statement

The if...else statement allows for conditional execution of code. It enables the program to make decisions based on whether a given condition is true or false.

### Data Types

C supports various data types, including int, float, double, char, and more. Understanding data types is essential for effective variable declaration and usage.

### Comments

Comments in C are used to explain the code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the compiler and are solely for the benefit of the programmer.
